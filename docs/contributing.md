# Contributing

Contributions are extremely welcome to both the framework itself and plugins.

Anything that involves design decisions should probably be opened as an issue first so we can openly discuss it, but any pull requests opened that are clear about their purpose will probably be accepted.

Feel free to join the [decker discord server](https://discord.gg/Dk2Yfc4) for any conversations or just to say hey.
